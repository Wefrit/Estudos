    Convert a number to a string of raindrop sounds based on its prime factors.
    The conversion rules are:
    - If the number has 3 as a factor, add 'Pling' to the result.
    - If the number has 5 as a factor, add 'Plang' to the result.
    - If the number has 7 as a factor, add 'Plong' to the result.
    - If the number does not have any of these factors, return the number as a string.
